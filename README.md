## Lottery Tent Calculator  
The bottle cap calculator uses information about what ranked prize (#1-10) you got in Festival Plaza's
Lottery Tents to predict what times you can get a prize of your choice if you visit the same Tent
on a given day.

According to [this reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeMoonSun/comments/5f9x25/how_to_get_bottle_caps_guaranteed_for_the_price/dajwh72/),
the prizes in a Lottery Tent shift predictably in 5 minute intervals. This calculator keeps adding intervals of
50 minutes to obtain all intervals on a given date, as well as fixes offset problems between what prize you got
and what your desired prize is.
